any of the five hotels based on their preferences (want they want). The booking portal must also allow tourists to order meals depending on 
their meal preferences,irrespective of the specific hotel where they are residents. The management of Capemint Holdings must be able to track sales
performance through a dashboard that enables bookings at individual hotels and total sales and total income for Capemint
Holdings from the five hotels to be tracked per time. The online booking portal must allow meal providers (caterers) to register
to provide services. Tourists/users must be able to search the list of registered meal providers and place an order to have a
meal delivered to their hotel accommodation.
